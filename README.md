# Airtable -> Google Data Studio Community Connector

This [Google Data Studio Community Connector](https://developers.google.com/datastudio/connector) (GDS) uses the Airtable Metadata\* and Base APIs to fetch a base's list of tables and fields (schema) as well as all records and make them available to Google Data Studio for visualization.

- Note that the Metadata API is currently available to Airtable Enterprise customers. Customers on other plans can request Metadata API access [here](https://airtable.com/shrWl6yu8cI8C5Dh3). The Connector will work without the metadata API, but will not be able to infer data types.
